# Apply the in-tree ggml patches (ggml-patches/*.patch, in filename order) onto
# the vendored ggml submodule. This keeps the submodule pinned to clean
# upstream; our project-specific ggml changes (fused rel-pos attention, NVFP4
# quantization, norm fusion, dw-conv F16, skinny-q8 GEMM, FastConformer BF16
# fusions, large-batch CUDA fixes, and MagpieTTS/NanoCodec CUDA ops) are applied
# at build setup time. Later patches also add the NVIDIA SM80+ cached-F16 route
# and a portable direct circular K/V fused-attention path with an SM80+ exact-
# shape register specialization.
#
# Patches that still reverse-apply cleanly are skipped. Apply the complete
# series to a clean submodule for deterministic setup; later patches may refine
# lines introduced by earlier patches, making reverse detection ambiguous on a
# fully patched tree.
# Usage: scripts/apply-ggml-patches.sh
